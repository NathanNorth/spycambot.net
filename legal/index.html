    <p>
        Spycam collects data from you and your VALORANT account when you authorize with your Riot account. Spycam keeps track of your match history, your rank, and some data associated with your Riot account. Spycam also collects some data from your Discord account (User and Channel IDs) when you use its commands. We collect and store this data to enable our services. Other users of this service may access a portion of that data by viewing things like your stats and rank. Your personal data will not be shared with third parties. At any time you can opt-out of data collection and have your data removed from our system by using the /optout command. If there are any questions or issues you can contact us at spycambot@gmail.com.
